# This file is automatically run when the package is imported
# So, a few key definitions can be placed here.
# It should import things from other .py files in this directory, e.g.
# from .text import test_asdf()
# See https://python-packaging.readthedocs.org/en/latest/minimal.html

# Don't actually need this line:
# from . import example_data_test
